# Task Management System Using Django

Django is a very robust full-stack web framework. It uses Python on the server side 
and provides API to integrate with almost any front-end web frameworks like React, Next, Vue, and Angular. 
In Django developers use MVT(Model View Template) architecture to build an application. In this
project on **Task Management System Using Django**, we are going to stick with built-in Django templates
that use the [Django Template Langauge](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/templates/language/). This 
project is a complete demonstration of Task Management System where the user can create their account and log in 
to the application. In the tasks section user can create a task with the rich text editor. 
From the home page, the user is capable of viewing, editing, and deletion a particular task.
